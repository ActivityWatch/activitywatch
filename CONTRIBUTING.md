 - Help fix bugs.
   - See the issues in this repo.

   - Want to start working on a new feature? Find the appropriate subrepo, if any, and see if there is anything that needs doing.

Most of the above will get you up on our [contributor stats page](http://activitywatch.net/contributors/) as thanks!


## Filing an issue

Thanks for wanting to help out with squashing bugs and more by filing an issue.

There are a few things you might consider when filing your issue:

 - Which version of ActivityWatch are you running? 
   - NOTE: There is currently no good way to find this out, sorry about that.
 - What made the issue/bug appear? (steps to reproduce)
 - Include a logfile
   - Log files can be found in different places, depending on platform:
     - macOS: `~/Library/Logs/activitywatch`
     - Linux: `~/.cache/activitywatch/log`
     - Windows: `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\activitywatch\activitywatch\Logs`


## Questions?

If you have any questions, post on [the forum](https://forum.activitywatch.net/) or email one of the maintainers at: [erik@bjareho.lt](mailto:erik@bjareho.lt).


## Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/activitywatch).
Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.
