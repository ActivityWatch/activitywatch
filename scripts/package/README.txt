Run move-to-aw-modules.sh to copy all modules except aw-tauri to ~/aw-modules/. Aw-tauri (replaces aw-qt), will use this directory to discover new modules. You can add your own modules and scripts to this directory. The modules should start with the aw- prefix and should not have an extension i.e `.sh`.

In the aw-tauri folder there are AppImage, RPM, and DEB binaries. Choose the appropriate one for your distro; if in doubt, the AppImage works on most Linux systems. If you decide on the AppImage, copy it to a permanent folder like ~/bin or /usr/local/bin, since autostart relies on the AppImage being in the same location each time.
