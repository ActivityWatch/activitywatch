User Interface
==============

Web Interface
-------------

ActivityWatch comes with a web interface which currently has the following features:

 - Activity overview
    - Most used applications by day
    - Timeline
 - Bucket overview
    - When a bucket was last updated
    - Listing of the latest events

More advanced and configurable visualization (such as the ones found in Zenobase and RescueTime) is not a priority and is unlikely to get implemented as a part of the core ActivityWatch project anytime soon.


Tray icon
---------

The tray icon (aw-qt) manages the core ActivityWatch services (server + watchers) and offers:

 - Manage which ActivityWatch services to run
 - Popup when a service crashes
