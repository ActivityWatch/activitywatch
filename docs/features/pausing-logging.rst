Pausing logging
===============

The possibility to pause logging is a low-tech solution to filter sensitive data.
You can do it easily by simply unchecking the watcher module you want to pause in the aw-qt trayicon menu, this will stop the watcher until you check it again.

So, if you for example want to pause the logging of window titles:

 - Click the ActivityWatch trayicon
 - Uncheck 'Modules -> aw-watcher-window'
